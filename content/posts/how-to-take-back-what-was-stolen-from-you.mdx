**For anyone that found the site via the newsletter**, I want to mention that these posts will be attached along with the current content. The newsletter is structured to be value-driven, while the website will be filled with other content like stories and topics related to bringing awareness to the *theft and deception* happening inside almost every interview process fellow software engineers tolerate to this day.

> Today the title is a statement that most readers may not even take seriously. "*How to take back what has been stolen from you".* If you haven't guessed what I'm reffering to being stolen, it's **MONEY.** And I'm not only talking to a junior dev searching for their first job... this includes people with years of experience and degrees. People who I've personally looked up to and worked with have even sadly ignorant to the horrible reality that our salaries were ass-backwards!

> While it is impossible to sum up all of this into one problem, the tradgedy is that any of us who work as programmers are purposly unprepared and made ignorant to the major skills required to demand a process and salary that mirrors our actual skill needed for the position!

> I won't go into the details here because I cover it for the team subscribed. But the fact that interviews never begin with a challenge to prove if we can type is unlike any other career path. Unless you get lucky, it's almost certain you will cross paths with a recruiter. Nobody seems to fucking care that building software requires a specific talent that could be compared to a brain surgen (meaning not just "anyone" can do what we do...).

> And still somehow it's almost guarenteed that the firm hired to recruit developers with job requirements that are stricter than any other career. They are called "gate-keepers", stating how much they help us to get hired, but do not even possess any programming background, sometimes no college degree attached!

Do I have your attention yet? Some high-school flunkie is somehow allowed to handle the financial outcome of our career and doesn't even possess a single skill that is required to apply for any job in our field (or even intern!). Could you imagine if a doctor was only allowed to interview at a hospital if a web developer recommended it?!? Let that sink in... there are poeple graduating with enough school debt to buy a house and are blindly encouraged to trust a stranger to decide if you can even be allowed to talk to the company hiring. 

 

 If you have already been working in the software industry, then maybe you went through enough interview processes to feel your brain feel some confusioin? 

*The feeling of a few eyeballs not believing this is even an issue has a presence in the air...* If you don't agree with my words so far, then I doubt anything I publish could change your mind. There will be some who say dumb shit like, "it's the "persons fault if they are an engineer and aren't smart enough to notice how much their value is worth...". I'm not claiming everyone should get outraged if they are happy with any results from finishing N interview process and receiving an offer
